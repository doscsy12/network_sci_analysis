## Network data analysis using networkx
Network science or network analytics, involve the analysis of network data and statistics to identify trends and patterns. It is part of graph theory, where a network can be defined as a graph in which nodes and/or edges/links have attributes. 
Here, we use python package networkX. NetworkX includes many graph generator functions and facilities to read and write graphs in many formats.
